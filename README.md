# random-password-generator
Third bootcamp challenge, using what we learned in class and outside research to make a random password generator. It must include being able to determine how many characters are allowed, between 8-128, if uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers are allowed. The process must be started by clicking on the generate password button, and display the finished product through either an alert() or on the HTML space provided.

Outside research included the usage of different Youtube Tutorials to help me understand the way prompt() works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmRYan3lAIo, and also some assistance on how to get my function working properly and fully understand how it works the way it does by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cdXwYEFDAg&t=5s.
